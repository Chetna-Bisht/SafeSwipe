Led a project focused on bolstering security in E-commerce and E-payment systems by leveraging Machine Learning techniques for Credit Card Fraud Detection. 
Utilized various classifiers including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forests (RF), along with ensemble methods to enhance model performance. 
Employed rigorous evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall to assess model effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions. 
Additionally, implemented techniques such as under-sampling and over-sampling to address class imbalance issues and improve model robustness. 
This project showcases a comprehensive approach to tackling cybersecurity challenges in online payment systems through innovative Machine Learning methodologies.
